Inside - silence, no one bothers you, and you yourself do not bother anyone.\n\n🍽 And the restaurant - a separate love in general.\nOwn confectionery, delicious Ukrainian cuisine, generous portions, very pleasant serving.\nBorsch with lard and donuts - like in childhood.\nKiev-style cutlet is perfect: crispy crust and juicy meat with fragrant butter inside.\n\n🌿 A special atmosphere on the summer terrace downstairs, where you can calmly eat or hold a meeting in the fresh air.\nAnd there is also a terrace on the top floor (it seems to be on the 3rd or 4th floor) - it can be rented for a holiday or a closed event.\n\n💡 Very convenient location, there is parking, Wi-Fi, everything is thought out to the smallest detail.\nA place where you want to return.",

I called the restaurant myself, they politely confirmed my order, said that they have started cooking, everything will be delivered on time, so don't worry. And, indeed, everything was delivered on time. A special big thank you to the courier with a bright smile and a positive attitude!\nAs for the dishes, all the dishes looked like the photos on the restaurant's website. We ordered a Workit breakfast, a meat club sandwich, a chicken fillet steak with baked vegetables.\nVery tasty, healthy and light meals!\nWorkit breakfast - appetizing, tasty, incredible!\nI liked everything, I recommend this institution.",

We’ll definitely come back again! 💯 It would be amazing to see this level of restaurant culture more often in other cities too.\n\nHighly recommended! ❤️",

Administrator tried to solve this problem, she and waiters were good, but the cook did not want to admit his mistake, although he burned the meat, it was burnt on all sides, cinders in the mouth. He wanted to justify this by saying that he cooked the steak on a stone, however, in the menu the photo of the dish and the description were about the grill, and what difference does it make, a steak on a stone should not be burnt. They made a discount on the steak, but did not exclude it, although it was almost not eaten. It's time to refresh the interior.",

They brought us complimentary sandwiches when found out that we have a flight. It was very sweet and the sandwiches were tasty. Interior is very nice, home vibes with a layer of intelligence. Coffee is really good, not over roasted (but f you prefer a dark roast, maybe it will be not bitter enough for you). Desserts: Anna Pavlova and Napoleon. But be aware that desserts are huge! Breakfast: shakshuka and set for two (with sparkling wine), hash browns with salmon is also good. Ask not to mix jam with sour cream if you order ”sirniki” for breakfast. Let them bring it in separate bowls so you could mix it according to your taste.",

    "review_text": "It would be more correct to call this place “Time Machine”. Once you cross the threshold, it’s as if you’ve stepped into 1999-2000 — and this feeling accompanies everything: the interior design, the toilets, the paper menus, the loud and annoying live music with color music.\n\nWe went in on a Saturday evening. The hall was almost empty, only two tables with people celebrating birthdays or corporate events. For a Saturday evening in Kyiv, this is already an alarming sign. But there was a person in our company who insisted on this place.\n\nNow about the most important thing — the food:\n• The shashlik was clearly prepared in advance and simply reheated before serving.\n• Kubdari with meat and cheese was disappointing — in some places there was meat, in others there wasn’t, and the taste was completely bland.\n• The potatoes on the plate were floating in oil, as if they had been cooked at home without much effort.\n• The frying pan with veal — rubbery meat, not juicy at all. There is no taste, and the prices are just out of this world. For comparison: it is more expensive here than in “Gogi”, but the quality of the food is much worse.\n\n+15% is included in the bill without warning.\n\nPerhaps the only thing that raises questions is the high ratings in the reviews. People, are you serious? Did you really like everything? Or did you just not go to other places?\n\nThe place is not recommended!",

Beautiful interior and original presentation of dishes.\nOutwardly, this is a European-style restaurant.  But this is only outwardly.  The service is similar to that of the old canteen of the USSR or the 1990s after its collapse.  The waiters are not friendly, not polite.  They don't communicate tactfully.  When buying food to go (ice cream), they do not offer to sit down to wait for an order at a table, and if they have water or a drink in their hands, they even prohibit taking a place while waiting, even on the street.  Despite the fact that it can be late evening when there are few visitors.\nI wish there was no such bad service and terrible communication of the waiters.\nI give one star for service and attitude.\nA separate topic is their ice cream.  This is the worst ice cream (gorgonzola) I've ever eaten.  It looks like a cloudy frozen block of ice.  With no pronounced taste and an unpleasant obsessive aftertaste of the synthetic aroma of coconut oil.\nI really do not recommend spending money here and spending your holidays.\nIt is a pity that there is no dislike function here, since this place does not even deserve one star.",

However, without any request from me, they served a portion that was three times the stated weight, and subsequently charged me triple the price I was expecting to pay. This lack of transparency and disregard for customer consent left a bad taste in my mouth, overshadowing the quality of the food.

    "review_text": "Barbara is an institution where you want to return for coziness, taste and sincerity. The display case with desserts is simply a magnet for the eye (and appetite), and inside there is light, warmth and an atmosphere in which it is pleasant to sit with friends and work alone. We had a coconut cappuccino (very smooth!) and immediately dived into the menu. Rice with shrimp is large, fragrant, real home warmth in a plate. Shavukha Spicy is a new level of street food: light, bright, with a cool balance of flavors. And Barbara's set with three different roles is a complete gastronomic pleasure, especially the one with eel 🤤 And, of course, sweet - here it is not just a dessert, but a separate reason to come: the monastery hut and Buck's cheesecake melt in your mouth. The service is pleasant and unobtrusive, and the prices are just a gift. If you are looking for a place with a soulful atmosphere and delicious cuisine, this is the place for you.",

    "review_text": "Even on our first dates, my husband took me to this establishment, when the menu consisted only of drinks and croissants. My favorite was the chicken and mushrooms. It was very tasty and unexpected for a coffee shop in a residential area. We have not betrayed Barbara for more than 5 years, because they are constantly developing, expanding the menu and always cooking amazingly. And also fantastically fast. The service is great!\nI recommend tasting sushi, bowls, miso soups, croissants almost Caesar or with salmon, pistachio napoleon, capo orange.\nThere are vegetarian dishes, sweets without sugar.\nYour children and pets will always be happy!\nAlso, I am especially grateful to the owners for the constant fees for the needs of the armed forces, for supporting the country's economy in such a difficult time and making so much effort for quality service!",

We didn't want to eat pork so they changed with chicken instead. Salads were really fresh. But for us the french fries could be less salty.\nOk, time for the prices. A really stuffy breakfast plate is 155 UAH (22 Aug 2021). Hot drinks are about 50-90 UAH.\n\nIn general, staffs are really kind and helpful.

Beside that Google maps showed the place was open till 2am on Saturday but we were asked to leave near 1am. However, we were lucky to find a cosy and pretty quiet corner to have a great chat, so we liked the atmosphere. The prices are too high for what you get I would say but considering it’s in the city center, well, okay.",

Not only at the district level, but really very cool, high-quality and tasty. The dough can withstand a day, it holds a lot of filling without sagging. The filling is very well balanced, even the pizza with white sauce is all very tasty.\n\nI also like the pricing policy. There is a very simple and cheap meat or pepperoni pizza, and there is mortadella with pistachios for almost 400 hryvnias - both are very tasty and worth the money, but it is the cost of the ingredients that dictates the price, not the imaginary \"price category\".\n\nThey always cook quickly and on time, and the service is friendly.\n\nI eat here every week and am happy that there is such a fantastic establishment nearby.",

    "review_text": "Client dining Vs delivery orders.\n\nI’ve been a regular customer here, coming once or twice a week, together with colleagues, because the food is genuinely good and it’s conveniently close to my workplace. Unfortunately, after today’s experience, I’ve decided not to return.\nI was told I would need to wait 40 minutes for a salad because the kitchen was busy with a large delivery order. I find it hard to understand how a guest who is sitting at a table, whether a regular who tips consistently or even a first-time visitor, can be asked to wait that long for a simple dish, just because of delivery operations.\nIn every country I’ve lived in, one basic principle has always held true: clients dining in the restaurant are given priority over delivery orders. That’s not just good service, it’s common sense. The people who are present, seated, and engaging directly with your staff deserve timely attention. In this case, my small order wasn’t even something that would delay delivery preparation, yet I was made to feel like an afterthought.\nTo be fair, this isn’t the first time this has happened. I experienced a similar situation last year, took a break from visiting for a few months, and only recently decided to give the place a second chance. Sadly, that chance was wasted today.\nI’m not sure whether this is a policy set by the owner or simply a decision made by the staff, but either way, it shows a clear lack of respect for customers who choose to dine in. It’s disappointing, and I truly hope the management reflects on how this impacts loyal clients and the overall dining experience.",

    "review_text": "Interesting place, nice interior, fast service. Pizza: delicious toppings and dough, it's great that they add sauce for the sides. I took off one star because either the dough is too thin, or the toppings are wet, or maybe the pizza was just out of the oven, but when you take a slice, the toppings float out of the dough, that is, the toppings come out separately in a box, and the dough is empty, you had to hold the dough with one hand, the toppings with the other to eat it together. I don't know why it happened, maybe it's a one-time situation and it only happened to me, but it wasn't very comfortable to eat, so this is a point for improvement (if this happens to others) or for consideration (if it only happens to me). In general, thank you very much for the pizza, the taste is really original and very tasty",

    "review_text": "I never write reviews, even in bad cases, but I couldn’t stand it here and left hungry. We ordered delivery, the pizza was simply disgusting, we tried it and threw it away. There was no sauce for the sides. “Di Carne” with burnt sides, salty, with chewy cheap prosciutto and salty salami. “Gorgonzola pear” with some cheap Philadelphia cheese and cream, you can’t feel the gorgonzola at all, it’s as if there isn’t one, the pears are small pieces, which are also tasteless, you eat it like dough with cheap, tasteless Philadelphia cheese. 2 small pizzas cost 626 UAH. I do not recommend this establishment to anyone.\n\nChanged: they contacted me and sent me 2 pizzas and a drink (kombucha) for free, this time they put sauces on the sides. The pizzas were already better, I ordered “Hawaiian” and “Luty Caesar”. I am very glad that the establishment does not care about its reputation and clients and they solve such unpleasant situations. I am attaching a photo of the new pizzas. Another thing is that they send by taxi, last time delivery to the door was indicated, the courier picked up, but this time for some reason delivery to the address was indicated and you had to go out to pick up the pizza, and the taxi driver, as always happens, is waiting for you at the wrong place entrance.",

But today, already during the order, I was surprised by the tone in which the young man accepted the order. Fuck off... It feels like I owe him something.  But okay (although not okay). But then it was at home when I opened the pies and found them burnt. The child is upset because I can’t feed him such smoke. Agree, these pies look a little different on the menu (many times).\n\nThey were talking about Dominos. Be that as it may, Dominos has standards to which Belissimo grows and grows\n\nYour answer makes me feel even less good about you. With this answer, you not only spoke poorly of Dominos, but also called your own clients (who come to Dominos) animals. Horror, not competence.\n\nWhatever your response to a particular review, everyone to whom I showed your response was surprised and amazed. A self-respecting company will not socialize with its neighbors. Which once again proves that you need to grow and grow in your professionalism. At a minimum, hire a person who will competently respond to reviews and put an end to it on time.  It’s not surprising that the pizzeria itself greets guests in this tone. All paths lead to the core of the company.\n\nHahaha I’m already laughing out loud at your “professional” response to reviews. I wonder if the owner of the company knows. I don't put a question mark, because... I want to end this fascinating conversation 😆",

Nice presentation on leaves, after opening such an incredible aroma that I wanted to taste it, I remember such a good sea aroma only in Yoshi 😁, separate bottles for additions to the rolls, regarding the additions themselves - a good sauce and wasabi, not too diluted, runny or strong, but the ginger is a little sour, as if it could be better\nAnd I will also mention a good portion of Chuka!!☺️\nThere was one popular network in my favorites for a long time, but finally a great alternative appeared 😍🤌\n\nPS I hope there will be positions on soups in the future ☺️",

At first glance, the rolls look like rolls, but the taste is HORRIBLE. Instead of cream cheese in the middle, there is some incomprehensible suspension with the taste of rubber. This is a LOT. Secondly, the wasabi, which should be at least a little spicy, was like a mixed powder without any taste with a slight smell of the same wasabi! And thirdly, the fish that was used there has been resting in the afterlife for a very long time, because the price for it is not even red! Thank you for the spoiled evening! If I recommend this establishment to anyone, namely in Svyatoshino, then only to my enemies!",

It was a little scary, because we just moved to Borshchagivka, and for us this institution is no name :) But it exceeded all our expectations! First of all, the site is very convenient, already clear, convenient and customer-oriented. The second is communication with employees: on the phone, the boy calmly, unobtrusively and very politely talked about all the nuances and steadfastly withstood my social survey \"is this? and do you give it here? and when? and what? and how?\" :) Delivery was handled by the owner of the establishment, which I think is a huge plus - because I follow the saying \"fish starts to rot from the head\", and when such an attentive, sincere and kind head, the team has nothing to worry about, they are in good hands. We were given moti as a gift and, I dare say, it is the tastiest moti I have eaten in Ukraine. Appearance, smell, size and, most importantly, taste - 100/10! This is incredible! 6 mouths, big and small, can confirm that. Thank you so much for the perfect addition to our holiday, thank you ",

The balance of products in all rolls, the fish is always fresh both in smell and taste. Always well rolled, does not fall apart and the rice is always as it should be. Our favorite was the baked rolls😋. And another thing I like about this place is that they deliver on time with a very friendly courier.",

    "review_text": "I have never written reviews but will do so now for future customers.\nFor the first time, we decided to use \"We Shushi\" and order a set for February 14!! Considering the high demand on this date, we ordered at 3:00 p.m. with delivery at 6:30 p.m. and paid immediately online. The order was not delivered either at the specified time or after 30 minutes, so we decided to call the support service on our own. The operator who picked up the phone promised to solve the issue and call, but again, after 30 minutes, I had to call myself because there was no feedback. After 2-3 times I managed to call the support service, they informed me that the order still needs to wait for 1 hour. There are no words. Terrible service, wasted time and considering the holiday and the fact that it was necessary to go to visit - a spoiled evening.\nI do not recommend anyone to order here.\nAfter reading negative reviews about the company, it immediately becomes clear that they do not take into account the comments of customers, but simply write back with standard (previously prepared) phrases.\nWe did not wait for the delivery and were forced to go on our own at 21:20 for the order.\nRegarding the quality of the rolls: hard rice, a minimum of fish and other ingredients, the rolls cannot be taken with chopsticks, they simply fall apart. Most of the roles were simply thrown into the trash. Only one rice can be tasted. Probably, your owners only care about how to squeeze more money out of people, and not about expanding the business and getting customers interested in providing quality services.\nI know that this message will not give me back either wasted time or a spoiled holiday, but it may create a real picture of the company. I do not renovate.\nP.S for the company, order number 602940 dated February 14, 2024, Kyiv (this is again in case of your standard “write the order number and we will figure it out”)",

Я понимал, что выпускные, как бы, ну и там, загрузка была чуть больше. Ну, мне позвонили в 19.02 администратор. И говорит, вы извините, пожалуйста, мы задерживаемся максимум 20 минут, и курьер уже будет у вас. Я ответ (Да, хорошо). Я делал заказ сет суши поинт с двойной начинкой и креветки тампура две штуки. Я заказываю уже более трех лет только в суши поинте и всегда заказываю с двойной начинкой. Я трачу минимум раз в неделю тысячу гривен. Бывает, я закупаюсь больше, чем на две тысячи гривен. И таким образом, по моим подсчетам, что в месяц компания только с меня зарабатывает от четырех тысяч гривен до приблизительно 12-13 тысяч гривен. Вот. И когда курьер приезжает не через 20 минут, а через час с холодными креветками, которые я хотел перекусить по-быстрому креветками и уходить, потому что меня ждали люди (которые злились уже на меня из-за того, что я опаздывал на 40 минут). А сет покушать уже по возвращению домой. То у нас получилась такая ситуация. Через час приезжает курьер. Я говорю, ну как бы это нехорошо. Это очень плохо. И мне типа решили заткнуть, грубо говоря, рот десятью процентами скидки. Оправдываясь тем, что были прям катастрофические пробки на дорогах. Я проезжал по этим дорогам. Я знаю, какая была обстановка. К тому же, я нахожусь ближе к центру. То есть, это, грубо говоря, с Борщаговки нужно было ехать в центр. Там пробок быть не может. К тому же, я видел, что там пробок нет. И мне рассказывают, что были большие пробки. То есть, мне получаются врут для того, чтобы отбелить свое имя. Мне это крайне не нравится. Мне это крайне не подходит. И честно сказать, что я не хочу заказывать после этого в суши поинт, где я заказывал постоянно. И пока мне руководство не одобрит. Два сета за счет компании. Это будут как извинения от компании по отношению ко мне. И я больше заказывать там не буду.Если руководство считает, что я не прав.. то в след за кораблем!",

When we asked the waiter for clarification, he responded dismissively, saying, \"What’s not clear? That’s just how it is here.\" Such an attitude is completely unacceptable.\n\nLong wait times and order mistakes:\nWaiting 40 minutes for salads is unreasonably long. Moreover, some of the ordered dishes were simply forgotten and never served, even after 80 minutes. The overall service was terrible — the waiter was completely indifferent.\n\nFood quality and presentation:\nUnfortunately, the quality of the food was also terrible, and the presentation left much to be desired.",

We had a few different Vareniki for starters. Kiev is lnown for its Salo, a kind of fat distantly resembling bacon, and this dish was a must-have on our table. A tranche of duck liver pate rounded off the starters. They have their own grill and make a fantastic shashlik and beef medaillons. The chicken Kiev is a true miracle! Chicken Kiev is a dish made from chicken minced meat, often styled in cordon-blue type fashion, stuffed with a Dill/Butter mixture. When cooled the mixture melts inside the meat and escapes to form a sauce once the meat is cut. Here they style the chicken to look like a chicken leg/ drumstick. They even add a little chicken bone to make it look like a real chicken leg. The spare ribs are good, but the sauce and flavor is not like the typical US Babyback ribs. A vodka room with over 80(!) individual vodkas is overwhelming and one might leave it to the staff to provide excellent suggestions. Contrary to what you might think, vodka is an excellent accompaniment to the food and does not need to be slammed down in a shot like manner. The restaurant offers a “vodka tree” with a selection of vodkas that can be shared with friends. Absolutely necessary to reserve in weekends.\nIf u dont know what to order, show them these pictures!",

Every detail is well thought. On Saturday night they had live music (traditional Ukrainian) and on Sunday lunch they had entertainment for kids. Not sure if it’s every week but during our visits that’s what we saw. Also every soup can be served in edible bread bowl for a small extra charge. It’s totally with it and the bread was very tasty.

The presentation of the food other than the bread bowl Borscht was rather poor. The location is Prime. It's in the centre of a park off of a main road. Most likely will be very beautiful in the summertime. Being that I visited in the winter I wouldn't know. The decor of the restaurant is a great traditional Kiev style. I thought the design was very nice. The waiters were very nice as well as the hostess. I would recommend the visit just for the experience if you're in Kiev.For more interesting reviews and places to visit check out @ricklemoinevip",

It is kind of difficult to find it being underground, you need to use a lift to get to it and use their password to get access. The password it is written almost everywhere there as a motto.

While we were selecting our meal we ordered drinks. Water and coffee arrived quickly, but I’d ordered fresh orange juice which didn’t arrive.\nWe then ordered our food, I chose rabbit borscht. My partner chose vareniki.\n\nThe waiting time was good and when our food arrived I was hungry and looking forward to tasting it. However what I received was a bowl of slightly warm brown water. Half a quails egg, 2 tiny fragments of potato less then 2cm cubed and a huge amount of dill. It was almost cold and there was zero meat. Nothing. Just water and dill.\n\nMy partner ate less than half of her vareniki because it was dry, but she said it was very tasty. When we were finished the waitress returned and asked if we wanted desert. No thanks. But where is my orange juice? She said it was being prepared and then gave me the bill. Only then did I get my orange juice that I’d ordered when we’d arrived around 90 minutes before.\n\nYou know when you order drinks before a meal they are supposed to arrive BEFORE the meal and not after you pay the bill…\n\nIt was supposed to be a special day for us. My partner is Ukrainian. I’m English and speak Russian. Perhaps the waitress was offended when I spoke Russian to her, and maybe this is why I received warm water and not borscht. This was the reason we did not order desert and left quickly.\n\nIt completely ruined our special day together.",

Very modern and cozy atmosphere. The meals where all above standard. The potatoes with a light truffle taste the brioche from burger was very tasty but not good for a burger. That’s maybe why they hand out plastic gloves for eating. The Barvy cake was outstanding tasty. Wit a lot hazelnuts. I think a real calories bomb! I can recommend this restaurant 100%",

    "review_text": "We went here for Saint valentine's day, they accommodated us with a table even though we called really at the last minute. The place is really warm and cozy and the personnel is super friendly, professional and makes you feel very welcomed. We've been given a table with the warn that we would have had just one hour available due to the obvious full booking considering the day,we thought it was more than understandable considering the situation and we agreed, a bit worried about the timings. Well, I can say that the order was super fast to arrive. I asked and, as professionals do, considering the day they've called extra cooks and kitchen personnel to avoid slowdowns. I believe this should be copied by many restaurants, even pricier ones, because we really received our order in 7-10 minutes with the restaurant full.\nWe've been greeted with a welcome limoncello and grissini that were really tasty, considering I'm Italian I might suggest to either buy it or make it with more alcohol though.\nI ordered a pizza and a pasta with truffle and porcini mushrooms, both amazing, the portion on the pasta should be bigger though, but in general it was ok, the quality of both the homemade pasta and the pizza was top notch, I just gave my advice to put the oregano inside the tomato sauce instead of on top and more salt in the pelati. Besides that i was surprised. I'm not in Italy after all.\nMy wife took gnocchi and we both enjoyed a nice Valpolicella and prosecco brought with the grissini at the beginning. The atmosphere was calm relaxed and cozy. Perfect for very age and every occasion, from birthdays to romantic evenings to work lunch with clients. The dessert was super good, cannoli from Sicily with ricotta were super nice, I would add pistachios, much more.\nCoffee was great.\nThe only thing I would say if I may consider it something \"to check and fix\" is the bathroom. The bathroom is clean and nice however the water doesn't have the mixer, is open or closed. If you leave it on for more then ten seconds the water goes to +60 degrees and you guarantee burn yourself. Maybe it was just that day, but yeah, looking quickly at the exposed tubes it seems like there was just the hot water coming with no mixer to regulate it for the client. Not really a problem, again, everything was excellent.",

The seasoning was an aggressive muddle - an overzealous attempt at flair that left the palate not tickled but thoroughly traumatised. Spices, bless them, were flung about with such reckless abandon that one began to suspect the chef had been mugged by a spice rack.\n\nAs for presentation - if one may use that term with indulgent charity - it bore the forlorn appearance of a dish assembled during a minor earthquake. There was no elegance, no balance, no trace of the sacred geometry one associates with thoughtful plating. Instead, what arrived was a culinary car crash: messy, incoherent, and alarmingly indifferent to taste or tradition.\n\nTo liken it to Chelentano or street food would be a grave insult to the noble vendors who ply their trade with pride and precision on pavements the world over. No, this was not street food - it was alleyway food, and not a particularly reputable alley at that.\n\nAnd the prices! One would think, given the audacity of the fare, that the menu had been transcribed directly from Versailles. For what was served, one might have expected at least a complimentary apology or a voucher for psychiatric support.\n\nIn sum, to dine here is to be cast into a peculiar food hell: a purgatory where flavour is misunderstood, aesthetics are criminally neglected, and your wallet weeps silent, salty tears into the void.",

As well as the pasta with spinach and salmon, which was super tasty too. The tiramisu for dessert was great & eaten up so quickly, that I didn't even manage to take a photo of it 😁To top of it all, the interior is really one of a kind, I'd be decided to go back there the next time I visit & try some of their other dishes. Make sure to give them a call & reserve a table though, as they tend to be quite full.",

The avocado and salmon toast was hard to slice with a knife - the bread was way too hard :(\nAnd last but not least we were made to wait for our bill long again and then the waiter brought only half of our bill.. so we waited again.\nDo not recommend.",

    "review_text": "Casa Lora is a wonderful establishment that is definitely worth your attention! We ordered home delivery, and everything arrived very quickly, the dishes were warm and incredibly tasty. It is clear that they care about quality and service here.\n\nI have also visited the establishment itself several times - the atmosphere is pleasant, the staff is friendly, and the service is at the highest level. I especially want to note the Cinque Formaggi pizza - it is simply perfect, as well as cocktails and risotto with mushrooms, which left only the best impressions.\n\nI would like to separately note that Casa Lora is not only a wonderful kitchen, but also an atmosphere that you want to return to. The design of the space - every corner is thought out to the smallest detail. The interior of the establishment creates a feeling of coziness and harmony.\nIn general, Casa Lora is a place where delicious food is combined with aesthetics and real comfort, a place where you want to return! I recommend it to everyone who appreciates quality food and good service.",

Gorgonzola Cheese was served on the top of the pizza similar like the herbal batter is served on the top of the stake. Seafood pasta was good, but only with one shrimp and without any mussels which was a bit disappointing. We recommend the mulled wine with spices - was delicious!

The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, the interior is thought out to the smallest detail, the style is exquisite, and therefore comfort is guaranteed!\nSpecial thanks to the staff — attentive, pleasant, sincere. Really nice people who love and do what they do. The Good People restaurant in Lviv offers a wide range of services: a children's playroom with an animator on weekends, live music, as well as a takeaway and delivery service.\nDishes are a separate story. Delicious, beautifully presented, everything is fresh. In addition to meat, fish and seafood dishes, the establishment also offers a lean menu.\nI recommend booking a table in advance, especially on weekends.\n\nSo, I went to lunch with my friends and ordered the following dishes: salami pizza, spicy tofu with shrimp and lentils, dumplings with tuna and river trout roe, onion soup. Portions at \"Good People\" are not about quantity, but about quality, aesthetics and refinement. Everything is served here as in a real restaurant: with attention to detail, finely thought-out composition and beautiful presentation.\nYes, the portions are not large, but that is their charm. This is an ideal option for those who appreciate not just satiety, but an emotion from food.\nAll in all, \"Good People\" made a great impression, and the visit left a pleasant aftertaste - and not only a culinary one.\n\nI will definitely come back again! :)",

    "review_text": "We were guests of your establishment and were disappointed. We ordered a ribeye steak of a certain degree of doneness, but it was not as ordered. We asked to fry the same piece of meat, it was taken to the kitchen and returned with the desired degree.\n\nAn unpleasant surprise was that we were charged 370 UAH on the check for frying our own meat. At the same time, no one warned us about such an additional payment. I consider such a practice to be absolutely unjustified and unfair towards the guests. If the chef did not cook it as ordered, then the correction of the error should be at the expense of the establishment, and if an additional payment is still provided, the guests must be warned about this before the service is performed. The point is not in the money, but in communication.\n\nUnfortunately, this situation spoiled the impression of visiting your establishment. I really hope that you will pay attention to this situation and review your approach to service so that other guests do not experience the same disappointment.",

It is worth paying attention to the quality of the dishes - in particular, the mashed potatoes were completely tasteless, watery, as were the dumplings and ribs with mashed potatoes, which had an excess of moisture, rather than a rich taste.\n\nUnfortunately, the prices are quite high, and do not justify the level of preparation. It would be good to review the recipes and presentation - the institution has potential.",

Overall it is definitely worth the money. I had a good time; even the toilets are super clean. The waiters all speak English fluently. Nothing to complain about. Thank you! Edit: I just realised, the prices are actually not correct, my strudel was in fact billed uah 10 more than on the menu. :(",

We reserved a table 30 minutes prior for our favorite seats and were ~10 minutes late without any notice of staff, that we will need to call again to extend reservations and lost our chosen table right in front of our noses without a chance to get it back. On top of that, the waiter we talked to, gave off a very arrogant and ignorant attitude that made me feel disrespected as a customer and as a human. Unfortunately we did not know his name, since he did not wear any badge. He was tall, with short and dark hair and a fade cut. Additionally after getting another table, they told us about a waiting time of 30-35, which turned out to be 50 and even my lemonade was not delivered after 20-30 minutes, which in itself is already a disaster. I am a customer from Germany who came here, because I had very pleasant experiences last time in summer, but the way I got treated this time, makes me consider to make this my last.",

Pickled mushrooms, salmon and white fish interesting, Facility traditionally decorated, has a gift house with preserves and other condiments and sweets. Reasonably priced, easy parking, bring the kids. Pork chops were meh. Have to edit this review from 4 to 5 stars. After my first trip to Lviv and Ukraine, Hungry Mykola had the BEST borscht of all the places sampled for this national dish. Well Done HM!",

Let me start from scallops, it was impossible to eat … Over-salted, too much garlic 🧄 and to be honest I got the feeling that it was digested by smb before, sorry to describe like that…But it is what it is. Warm salad: I got a feeling that a palm of seafood was just topped my cream , no taste at all. We didn’t finish our meal …Please, review the way you cook it and serve it!",

    "review_text": "Visited your café recently and had a mixed experience. I initially wanted to order a matcha orange drink and a sandwich, but I was told the wait time would be up to 35 minutes. I decided not to proceed with the order because I couldn’t wait that long.\n\nHowever, my sister placed a similar order right after me – a shrimp muffin and a lemonade. Surprisingly, her lemonade was prepared in just 2 minutes, and the muffin was served within 18 minutes of ordering.\n\nThis inconsistency was confusing and a bit frustrating. If the wait time can vary so much between customers and similar orders, it would be helpful to clarify that in advance. I hope this feedback helps improve the communication and service flow for future guests.",

(I thought both were delicious)\n\nWe ordered sizzled chicken but there was no kitchen so they again, prepared another dish to make up for it. We ended up eating a lot more than planned.\n\nEverything tasted amazing nonetheless. I especially liked their deep fried lavash with cheese and their chicken wings. All of the sauced were very well balanced, not too milky and not too thick. Just perfect.",

Chotyri Griba is also good, but I always prefer meat pizzas, but it is worth paying attention if you like mushrooms.\n\nWaiting time 45 minutes, ordered at approximately 7 pm.",

This is not just a food establishment - it's a place where you want to return again and again!\nThe first thing that struck me was the atmosphere. Stylish, cozy, with a thoughtful interior down to the smallest detail. It's equally comfortable for a family dinner, a meeting with friends, and a quiet dinner for two.\nThe service is at the highest level. The staff is friendly, attentive, and sincerely interested in ensuring that each guest is satisfied. Orders are taken quickly, everything is served on time, and most importantly - with a smile.\nAnd now about the main thing - pizza. It's something incredible! The dough is perfect: thin, crispy, aromatic. The filling is generous, the products are fresh, the combination of flavors is impeccable. The prices are absolutely justified by the quality.\nWe sincerely thank the IQ team for the delicious moments, professionalism, and love for their work. This is exactly the case when service and cuisine are harmoniously combined. Without a doubt, we recommend it to everyone!\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)",

    "review_text": "This pizza is a real work of culinary creativity! It has a dense golden crust, well-baked cheese and an appetizing appearance. The most interesting thing is the unusual use of triangles of processed cheese that resemble pieces of American cheddar. They are chaotically laid out, but this is what gives the pizza a special character. There's also a light sauce—perhaps tomato or chili—that adds color and probably a savory flavor. And flax seeds (or other similar spices) add texture and goodness. Definitely a non-standard, but interesting interpretation of the classic pizza - for those who like experiments!",

Today, when I came to the institution, I offered to try their delicious limoncello at the expense of the institution. And you know, I've tried it in many places, but I liked it the most in this establishment. You can't smell vodka, only citruses❤️ and I love their crisps😍😍❤️\nNow I have a question for the owner: is it possible as a permanent one?\nclient, crispies always double portion for me?😅❤️",

There are 3 items on the children's menu and they are adequate in composition, so it's not a burger and fries, like in most establishments, but soup, pasta and pizza, everything is great in composition. And here is the shock content - the children's menu is FREE, when ordering something from the menu for an adult. I have not seen anything like this anywhere. This is a great move. Furthermore, you can bring dogs, there is a lot of space and you can accommodate everyone and no one will \"blow\" each other in the back. The waiters immediately brought the dog some water, just like people. The service is top, all the waiters are friendly and polite. The menu - we ordered 2 business lunches and simply \"ate very\" tasty and nutritious. The portions are very large. The design - everything is new and clean. I wholeheartedly recommend this establishment for any company, because the menu has everything, both delicious menus and various drinks. Prosperity to such institutions and services 💫🫶",

As for the rolls, they're not big, they're gigantic. These are the first rolls we've tasted that you can't eat one roll at a time 😅, you have to bite 😁.\nYou can't feel the rice in the sushi at all, there's a huge amount of filling and the freshness of all the products. But a huge plus is that the rolls of this size don't fall apart, they stay together, even if you add a lot of soy. My child, who loves maki, asked at first where I ordered such large ones 😄, and they're big not because there's a lot of rice, but because there's a lot of filling. Therefore, I sincerely recommend everyone to try them.",

I’m used to rich flavours in Asian cuisine and I was missing it in my ramen. It was also not really spicy but on the menu it wasn’t sold as a spicy dish, but maybe serving this ramen with chilly oil would be great as there is only one veggie ramen on the menu and the guests who like spicy food would have an opportunity to spicy up their dish if they want.",

Unfortunately unlike other places when you order ramen it doesn't come as noodle soup it only comes as noodle, which was very disappointing. But fortunately it tasted really good. The pizza was very delicious, I strongly suggest it. But don't go there if you are really hungry because they bring it really late.",

Firstly, the delivery arrived on time as it was agreed at 19:00, which is already a big plus. The packaging was very good and all the dishes arrived in good condition. I ordered a mix of rolls, the sushi was extremely tasty and fresh. I was especially pleased with the salmon roll - it was tender, and the filling was sufficient. It is very pleasing to have a diverse menu where everyone can find something to their taste. I will definitely order more. I recommend \"Osama Sushi\" for ordering for any occasion - tasty, fast and high-quality!",

On the one hand if everyone check your covid certificate, then ok: be safe, stay at home, etc. But on the other hand, this restaurant is located inside big complex \"Spartan\" and nobody checks certificates at the entrance. Why do they check in \"Noa\"? It's ridiculous. Moreover, if anybody without certificate visit Lviv because of some needs, where he/she can eat? Just buy something in supermarket and eat outside in winter with temperature about -10?\nApart from that, food is good, but I have had better, that's why I put 4 stars instead of 5.

There was a live music as well which was a nice compliment.\nTo dine in this place we were waiting outside for half hour to get sited. Initially we were taking to the room downstairs and were surprised as several tables were unoccupied. The question is: why they didn't invite us to sit sooner but left us waiting outside on the cold?\nThe basement hall had no internet connection and less nice than the main one, so we asked to be moved as some people left. That was ok. We were permitted to stay on the main room.\nWe ordered for 4 people. First arrived one dish for one of us, 30 minutes later arrived another one and 30 minutes after that arrived other two. They were simple dishes. Why should we have waited for an hour??? We probably were forgotten.\nThe 'pork meat Gutsul stile' was nice as well as 'oven baked vegetables with cheese' but the 'oven baked chicken potatoes under chees' was rubbish.\nOveral experience: tried it once. It was okeish but wouldn't come back.\nService and food were very average as well as the price.",

    "review_text": "Front of the restaurant staff were on their phones too much not paying attention (use your phones on break out of sight). Worse was the pizza cook. I ordered a pepperoni with chicken (I also asked for mushrooms and they said they don't have fresh mushrooms just mushrooms that come prepared in their white sauce). The pizza cook refused to add chicken as s topping, flat out refused after being asked. Claiming it doesn't make the pizza look good. Never in my life has a chef/cook insist they will not take special orders from a paying customer. Honey on the pepperoni pizza had an off flavor, probably not needd. Super awkward when the chicken was brought out as a side dish along with the pizza. There's a first time for everything.\nNot recommendable. Restaurant looked clean and orderly otherwise.",

The atmosphere inside is peculiar, probably not everyone will like it, but I liked it - it is pleasant in its own way, but there is room for growth in this regard :)\n\nPizza is just great!\nThe price, of course, is appropriate, not cheap, but, in my opinion, what you get for it fully corresponds to it. While walking home with my pizza, I fell in love with the aroma wafting from the box. The combination of ingredients is perfect, the dough is wonderful, in a word: beautiful.\n\nIf you are reading this review and thinking whether it is worth coming here, it is definitely worth it!\nAt least to support small business.\n\nThanks to the owner for my lunch today - he made this sunny spring day even better =)\n\nGood luck and prosperity, and goodbye, because this is definitely not my last visit",

The focus feels far more on aesthetics than substance. The dishes looked beautiful, but the flavours were underwhelming and the portions were shockingly small – especially considering the price point. I'm from the UK and even by our standards, the pricing felt excessive for what was served.\n\nThe main courses were closer in size to starters, and we actually ended up going to another restaurant straight after as we were still hungry. Disappointing overall. If you're after a visually appealing spot for a drink or a quick bite, this might work – but for authentic, satisfying Italian food, I’d suggest looking elsewhere.",

Order some of the more traditional dishes, not just the kebab!\n\nOnly minor issue was with wasps.  They should really use wasp traps rather than just trying to distract them with more food a little further away.",

    "review_text": "Truly inspired decor, great service, perfectly cooked dishes to the highest standard. I went here with a friend and then also ordered delivery - both were perfect experiences. I had ordered the head chef's cookbook all the way from USA (Seattle) as he is the only one I could find who wrote down some of the traditional Odessa dishes - not Ukrainian, not Russian, not Jewish - special to Odessa. The restaurant itself perfectly captures all the beautiful parts of soviet children's summers at the \"dacha\": summer home with garden. Freshest ingredients, cooked with love and perfect balance of seasoning (often lacking around Ukraine). Amidst choices of poor impressions of Thai, Japanese, Italian and French cuisine abounding in Odessa, do not miss this gem of a restaurant cooking the food that Odessa and Ukraine does best!",

    "review_text": "Beautiful sea-view location with tasty food but slow, cold service. We visited Yug in Odessa today. The location is lovely with a fresh sea breeze, and there was live music (a bit too loud for my taste). The food was extremely delicious – every dish we tried was tasty, and the kitchen is worth visiting for the flavors alone. However, the service felt cold and was very slow. We waited 25 minutes for appetizers, and then everything arrived at once with the main dishes. Our baked vegetables never came after 45 minutes, and we had to cancel them. Also, the wine prices were surprisingly high, though food prices are average. Overall, I recommend coming here if you want to enjoy the kitchen and sea view, but be ready to wait.",

We have already chosen a wine from California (a rose one) when she arrived our table she said there is no option from California even though it’s already on the list and she did not say any apology words for that. Also she suggested another wine for us and added “it’s not expensive”! How dare you said to us it’s not expensive!!! It’s not your job, lady!!! And the worst thing when she was saying that she has a bad & weird attitude and approach. We changed our mind and ordered a cocktail for us. It’s obvious she is not happy to work there or she has fought with her Mom or her boyfriend! It’s not good to have such an employee for such a high quality restaurant!\nFor information the owner or HR department of this great restaurant!",

Definitely one of the most expensive restaurants in Odessa. And with that said the food should at least be better than this. I live in on of the most expensive countries in the world. And for the same price there I could get a super fancy dinner. The limit was reached when they asked us if we wanted to pay the tipping in cash or card. At least they could give us a bread or something while waiting for the food - or say sorry for waiting. I tip if the service is great. Not if I'm forced.",

I also adored the staff, particularly one sweet, young girl who was so kind and attentive. The overall experience was so exceptional I went two days in a row.

And to make your evening unforgettable, I highly recommend you to order red sangria which tasted like it was delivered right from Spain!

Every piece is carefully kept and placed for you to enjoy your coffee ritual by yourself or in the company. Our five year old daughter could not get enough of this place! As well as us. Coffee was great too, btw. Did not check the desserts. Good service.",

Atmosphere, cakes and coffee are very special and so great. 100% pure old Odesa interior design, a lot of nice small things from Odesa former times and nice quiet music make atmosphere so local and romantic. Cakes are the most delicious I have ever experienced. I would recommend to try \"Kiev cake\" - that is my favorite. You can buy the whole cake or order it in advance - it is very good idea in case you are going to visit your friends. My honest mark is 7 out of 5 :)))))",

Perfect. Kind and extremely effective, good recommendation in English and very patient with our kind, the touristy \"what's this what's that\" kind.\nThank you again for this amazing experience!!!\nWe will come back to Odessa just to eat there.\n\nA must-taste.",

I only give it 4 stars because even though the Tiramisu was tasty, it should appear on the menu as \"Raspberry Tiramisu\" as they decided to use berries and no coffee, which is what I expect when I read Tiramisu, and is the original recipe. Next time I'll try the Panna Cotta. Prices were not bad either.\nUpdate: Liana was the best waitress ever, so I literally almost cried the last time I went there and said goodbye to her.",

The ingredients were of high quality, both in main dishes like pizzas and pastas as well as side dishes and salads.\nThe location of the restaurant is also ideal because it is in the heart of the downtown Odesa and in particular, it is located within Passage, a significant architectural landmark of this city.\nThe service however, was mediocre at best.\nThe particular day when my family visited the restaurant was a day when there was a citywide water outage.\nThis no doubt creates difficulties for a restaurant but there could have been workarounds that the restaurant could have taken but did not.\nFor example, there is no water in the restroom to wash hands. There could have been pitchers with water or at least antiseptic sprays or wet wipes placed there for guests.\nSame goes for tables where there is no means to clean one’s hands before eating when the water is out.\nFurthermore, the waiters seemed unenthusiastic and preferred to hang out outside when we were dining inside and we needed to go out to call them on some occasions.\nSo while the location of the restaurant, the interior and decoration and of course food was good or excellent, the subpar service and attitude of staff let down the experience.",

No judgments, condemnation.\n\nThe interior of the establishment is original, located in the very heart of the Passage.\n\nThe idea with the inscription \"this\" on the cocktail is wonderful, a must for photos!! I advise you to try the Sicilian Courtyard.\n\nI would replace the pasta, perhaps because they are rather large from hard varieties, but overall it is delicious.\n\nThank you for such a pleasant experience, delicious food, great service!

Warm rolls are not greasy at all, as they are in other establishments. The rice is cooked very professionally, seasoned fabulously, I can say this as a sushi chef in the past. The roles are even and very neat. And Sushiburger is simply the BOMB!!! There are a lot of fillings, the taste is incredible. And what surprised us, we were worried that it wouldn't be enough, but we ate our fill!!! Very tasty and nutritious. We were very satisfied. Now we eat only at your place!!! Thank you to the staff for a quality and delicious dinner!!!!",

Plenty of non-cream cheese options. Beautiful plating with vibrantly colored fish eggs.\n\nThe nigiri cuts were comically large. In a lesser restaurant, they would use the same amount of fish for two nigiri.\n\nThe staff were so attentive that if you simply looked their way, they would come o er and check on you.\n\nAtmosphere was beautiful. It was a wonderful date spot, and judging by the other couples in the quiet upstairs dining room, it’s a popular one!\n\nJust writing this review makes me want to go back there for dinner tonight.",

Portions are huge and if you order food for at least 1700 UAH you can get from them Japanese wine as a gift. I enjoy my Thai soup and pad Thai very much. Sushi was large, the only one thing I would say that the amount of cheese was too much for me, but hey, they have other great options as well! The quality of fish there is amazing especially salmon. Thanks guys for a good experience I’m only sad I didn’t get chance to try your coffee because it seemed quite interesting :)",

Staff is friendly and also dressed in a contemporary Japanese style which just adds to the experience.\n\nA very wide selection of dishes is a big plus. The roll omelette was just superb! Had it twice. Ramen soup was very good. In general all the dishes we tried were such rich in taste and flavour.\n\nJapanese Whisky was nice and dessert be it a bit small for my liking were very tasteful.\n\nPricing for this part of Odessa and the quality of food, place and services is good. I never felt that I was overpaying for anything.\n\nDo highly recommend anybody who likes Japanese cuisine or wants to taste it to go and visit SUKE Bistro!\n\nPs. Even the menu itself looks amazing!",

Payment on the site is clear, plus a nice bonus when registering in the form of cashback, which can be used on the first order. Placed the order at 11:10, at 11:42 I already received an SMS that the delivery was on the way. Pleasant courier from Bond taxi, polite and friendly, delivered the order as expected in a thermal bag in a branded bag from the establishment. The first impression is very good, the taste is excellent, I liked the fact that the set was laid out in different boxes. There are a lot of fillings, everything is fresh and delicate in taste, the aftertaste is also pleasant. The sushi does not fall apart and is beautifully rolled, as it should be. Everything is super, we will order in the future, for the first time in a long time, the Basketroll establishment is my favorite!🫶❤️",

I've been to sushi restaurants in Japan, England and US and I can say this is one of the best sushi places in Odessa after Kobe restaurant. Salmon is really fresh, tuna is not as fresh, probably due to difficult supply and logistics, and maybe lack of demand on the market here. Rice is almost ideally cooked. Menu has just the right proportion of classic sushi and author's rolls to choose from. Prices are probably a bit higher than in most popular sushi chains, but it's totally worth it.",

Unfortunately, the dishes do not correspond to their prices.. the borscht was good, the dranikis were top notch.. and the most disappointing was the rabbit with potatoes - in fact, it was a reheated dish, the potatoes were not fresh, dry with a withered crust, frozen vegetables from a bag and 2 pieces of rabbit in which 90% is bone - and for that the price is almost 400 UAH 🤯 only the bread on top was tasty. It's very sad and unfortunate - it looks so good and the execution is so bad (( we asked the waitress to guide us through the range of beers - she said she didn't understand it and didn't even try to go and ask the bartender.. the same as people (below in the comments) we didn't leave a tip for the first time in our life.

This establishment does not just meet expectations, it exceeds them, creating a holistic and unforgettable experience.\n\nThe interior impresses with its thoughtfulness and aesthetics. Every detail, from the choice of furniture to lighting, works to create an atmosphere of comfort and modern elegance. It is not just beautiful, it is harmonious and inspiring, which allows you to feel like you are in a special place where beauty and comfort are respected.\n\nHospitality is felt from the first steps. The staff greets you with a sincere smile and willingness to satisfy any wish. This is not intrusive, but soft service that anticipates your needs and imperceptibly takes care of your comfort. Such an attitude creates the feeling that you are not just a guest, but a desired visitor who is appreciated.\n\nAnd, of course, the main emphasis is on the aesthetics and taste of the dishes. Each dish is a true work of art, where visual presentation is an integral part of the culinary experience. The exquisite taste emphasizes the mastery of the chef, who skillfully combines traditional Ukrainian motifs with modern culinary techniques. The highest quality ingredients, original combinations, and, of course, the passion with which each dish is prepared - all this creates a unique ensemble that leaves a pleasant aftertaste and a desire to return again.\n\nUyava is truly a vivid example of how the Ukrainian restaurant business can rise to a new level, offering not just food, but a whole range of emotions and impressions. This is a place where harmony and perfection meet.",

Guacamole and risotto were a bit sour, to be honest, but that might be a local phenomenon, since I am not too familiar with Ukrainian cuisine. It was a bit loud, but music was very nice. The waiter was absolutely amazing. Will definitely go there again when I come back to Odessa. If you only have time for one item, try the cake. It is incredible.",

I like that they work together, each waiter would serve you if you ask for a bill or additional food. We ate also little pancakes, avocado toast, sandwich, snails and oysters. They serve breakfast till 17 what is very nice 🤗. It's busy place but worth. The price are higher but acceptable.",

The food is not only amazingly tasty and beautiful, but the flavours are combined in ways that are new but somehow feel like you’ve always loved them this way. It is like high cuisine and home cooked food at the same time. We were pleasantly surprised with the service, especially with our three noisy kids and the large stroller. We felt very welcome and the kids enjoyed their modified custom meals. The special of the week, the pike was just out of this world. The greens in the salads were all super fresh. The kids loved the freshly made lemonades. The Napoleon cake is very tender and soft with a perfectly moderated sweetness.",

The food was pretty good though and they use fresh and good quality ingredients. The burger was honestly above average, but nothing super special. The beef quality was above average, but I've had much better burgers. But the curry chicken with pineapple was excellent; the chicken was so tender and the entire dish was cooked to near perfection. Definitely the best thing that I had from the 2 dishes I ordered. Overall, I would recommend.\n\nAlso the restaurant is hard to find: it's down an alley and at the end of the alley you'll see some gates and there will be a button for the restaurant that you have to push.",

The interior is beautiful, created to be like an oasis. The staff were all professional, especially the gentleman at the door hosting and the younger staff who organized table settings. The French wine was lovely paired with salmon tartare, toast and a cream cheese while the seafood soup was saltier which went well with the crusty bread - my offset was it was served mild and the seafood was a bit tougher when compared to soups delivered hot/fresh. Aside from that, I didn’t realize there was a service charge added to my receipt automatically in which I tipped in addition without knowing. I would have happily done it still but was not advised ahead nor provided card slips for the separate transactions (would assume courtesy is to advise guest there is a gratuity added, especially when they cannot read the language which is why server gave them a translated menu). Nonetheless, this doesn’t take away from the overall nice experience.",

Interesting execution of dishes that are in traditional cuisines. And zucchini chips are just bimba! The prices are pleasant.

    "review_text": "I really liked this establishment, last year we celebrated all our birthdays in Felice. It was always tasty and cozy.\nBut since the first boss Maksym left, everything is getting worse and worse. Changes in the menu are not successful at all. I used to have a delicious shrimp risotto, actually tastier than Italy. It was replaced by a Seafood Risotto, in which a couple of large, unpeeled prawns float among rice and mussels in the shell. You will have no chance to eat this dish aesthetically. Because all this must be cleaned by hand. As a result, the enjoyment of food is zero, only a mountain of waste on the plate.\nBefore the new year, they still ordered and sent a recommendation to the kitchen to return the previous version of risotto with shrimp, a couple of months have passed, nothing has been changed.\n\nI used to adore risotto with meat in wine. Today I did not understand at all what was brought to me. The price is about the same, but be prepared that the portion is twice as small. As an example in the photo, I ordered the risotto before the New Year and today. The taste is also not very good, it was tastier.\n\nIn general, it is very unfortunate that good establishments lose taste and quality over time, and do not listen to customers. Because I am not a hater at all and defended this establishment among all my friends who had a negative experience and categorically refuse to eat here. Now I don't want to come back here either.",

The food seems tasty, with a claim to haute cuisine, but the portions are not quite adequate. You can eat your fill with an appetizer, but not with a main course. A portion of pasta carbonara is like for a child, as is the risotto for duck. The interior of the cafe-canteen. But the dishes are beautiful, and the taste of the dishes is excellent. But then we bought pizza from neighbors, and went home to satisfy our hunger). In general, we came based on reviews on Instagram. We will not repeat the visit for the second time soon...",

There were no seats in the restaurants we had checked, so we went to the restaurant \"Piccolo\" we found nearby. The restaurant's design is quite decent, without any special claims, there are few visitors - practically empty. And this is on Saturday evening. The menu claims to be close to Italy, and so do the prices. We liked the \"Beef cheeks with polenta\", but didn't like the other dishes because of the strange combination of the main product and sauce. The salad was made \"based on\" the description we received from the waiter. There was no draft beer, and the homemade wine slightly smoothed out the situation. In general, we didn't want to sit for long, and given the local prices, this restaurant went deep into PicE in my rating :(",

That was Saturday day, and the restaurant was full, and a lot of tables were reserved, so the waiter checked which table was free for at least one hour for us (this shows a level of very good service).\nThe atmosphere was very lively, the music, what was playing, extended atmosphere inside. Service was also good because even with a full restaurant, we got our food very fast. The staff was helpful and efficient.\nThe food was tasty and delicious. Also, I liked how dishes with food were presented.\nWe got only 1 negative note. The waiter forgot to add one position to our order, but after a reminder, we got what we wanted.\nThe price was reasonable and a good value, also we didn’t forget to leave a tip.\nDefinitely, I would visit Trattoria again.",

    "review_text": "Amazing idea performed with upscale taste resulted in a fantastic restaurant. It represents 5 level dining where each level is decorated with its own twist keeping the general idea though. It can allocate a lot of visitors, however the majority of seating are 2-, 3-, maximum 4- seaters, which makes Paris fantastic place for dates or intimate friendly chatting. Generously decorated with live plants restaurant litteraly fills you with fresh air. Their menu deserves its own line: impressive wine cart, separate desserts offerings (not just a last page in main menu) combined with non-alcoholic drink, and main part that is strictly a No fast-food menu. They are very mindful about healthy eating which is vividly presented in their meals selection. Some meals comes in a generous portion, and they have specific sign next to its name in a menu, so that the guests can understand what to expect. There are free apples for kids next to the entrance, and free fresh juices for pregnant visitors. Prices are very adequate to the quality of the good and the level of the place itself. Would I come here again? Definitely!",

The waiters took advantage of the fact that we are foreigners that do not understand Russian thus overcharging us on steaks. According to him we ordered 500g steak each and each 100 gram is 129грн. It's not the worst place but those waiters gave us a bad experience as in to never visit that place ever again.\n\nDont try to get rich over people who are barely making it in a foreign land.

But the meat itself to taste is not just a piece of the sole and is not close to worth the price that is asked for it.",

Borscht was brought with lard and toasted bread, very tasty and adheres to tradition. Lemonade with lemon and lime - for those who like it sour, for them it will be very tasty.

    "review_text": "On January 12th I celebrated my birthday with my friends at the Kohana cafe, to say that I had a blast, that this was my best birthday is to say nothing 🫶\n\nThe atmosphere of beauty around, beauty in every detail, in the presentation of dishes, in the dishes themselves, everything is so beautiful, my friends even noticed that each dish has its own plate, or rather the shape of the plate, glasses for water, cups for tea, everything is so beautiful 🥰\n\nThere were three of us, me and two of my friends, each of us ordered what she liked and we were satisfied, the first time we didn’t guess with tea (I don’t remember the name, but something with sea buckthorn), it didn’t go down well with us, but the second one was very tasty, with mango. We also ordered different desserts and each of us had a delicious one 😋\nOne of my friends switched to a special diet and doesn't eat flour or sugar. When choosing a dessert, the girl told her in detail which desserts fit my friend's criteria and she made her choice (in the photo, it's completely covered in chocolate) 🫣\n\nWe were very pleased with the table service. Our waitress (unfortunately, I don't know her name) was very polite and tactful. When we first arrived, we couldn't stop talking and couldn't think of any order. Then one friend chose what she wanted and my other friend and I couldn't decide for a long time. The girl calmly waited and took the order. We never felt pressured to think for a long time or sit for a long time or not order anything. Everything was so wonderful. At some point, the girl came up to me and asked whose birthday it was. And when we were about to eat our desserts, the girl and several other waitresses came up to me to congratulate me on my birthday. I felt so nice, I was so happy 💗\n\nI am incredibly grateful to the cafe \"Kohana\" for the aesthetic pleasure, for every thoughtful detail, for delicious food, desserts, quality service, for making this day, this time with friends special, bringing a little magic and sorcery 🙏\n\nP.S. A year ago I was already in this cafe, but was not impressed, but I am happy that I chose to celebrate my birthday with my friends in it.\nI told this to the fact that if you had an unsuccessful experience with this cafe, like me, maybe you should try again, maybe you were with the wrong company, in the wrong state or just at the wrong moment.\n\nThank you again and sincerely recommend 🙏🥰💐",

The croutons were overdried. In general, we were disappointed. The salad was ruined anyway!!! We told the waitress some of the shortcomings, they passed them on to the kitchen.

The flavors were incredibly authentic, the crust perfectly crispy, and the toppings were fresh and delicious. The atmosphere and service were also top-notch, making the whole dining experience unforgettable. Highly recommend Felice to anyone looking for a taste of true Italian pizza!\n\nPS: Their milkshake is a MUST",

Pizza is not like Ncapole or Sicily.  It is far from Italian general!  But locals and guests love her very much.  This place works like a buffet.  You order at the bar and then the waiters take the customer to the table.  Delicious salads are prepared here, a traditional salad with boiled tongue!  I recommend this place.  Especially nice on the summer open air!",

    "review_text": "We decided to celebrate one of the most important days in our family - an anniversary. We wanted to do it in this establishment and it was a MISTAKE\n\nYes, there are no questions about the food, everything was delicious\n\nBut there are a few important BUTs because of which we will not return to this establishment\n\n1. Service. The waitress (a young, friendly girl) tried to serve us well, but throughout the entire time there was a feeling that she was afraid of us\n\n2. It was an anniversary, that is, a birthday. On the website, Instagram and on the menu page there is a tab where it is written that on the birthday there is a DISCOUNT for the customer -15%.\n\nBut we were refused this. Apparently this discount is valid ONLY for a company of 6 people and if the check is more than 6 thousand UAH (there were 5 of us, if anything).\n\nInteresting, right? Because there is NO such information ANYWHERE (please note the screenshots, where there are no explanations with exceptions). I'm sure this is a fabrication of the waiters, so as not to make any discounts.\n\n3. The establishment has a promotion for pizza 2=3 and a taco combo. We asked the waiter about the tacos, but she couldn't give us an answer and went to the admin. It turned out that the establishment doesn't have a promotion for tacos. But this information is also NOT AVAILABLE ANYWHERE! (there are also screenshots).\nTo which I asked: \"does the promotion apply to pizza?\", to which the waiter answered me: \"yes, for pizza\"\n\nInteresting, because then when paying it turned out that the promotion DOES NOT APPLY, supposedly only for delivery.\n\nHow is that? First, the waiter said \"yes\", secondly, our friends made orders at the establishment in the same month and the promotion WORKED!! We were also at your place in the spring and the pizza promotion in the establishment also worked\n\nHow do you explain this? That is, you look at the customers and decide based on their appearance whether to give a promotion or not? This is a very unpleasant attitude towards customers.\n\nHow will you solve this issue?",

Reservation is fine but I think it's not fair how they can reserve those specific nicest tables. It should be first come first serve. Also they don't have a system for which tables are empty so you just have to see which are empty lol",

The fries were still warm and tasty after a 10 minute walk home so that was nice too. Met Alex (the owner I think) who spoke English was very helpful in pointing out what I was able to order. Thanks and will see you soon. (Scottish guy with Celtic top)",

    "review_text": "Good evening, today I bought a burger from this establishment, they recommended a cheese burger, so I took it for a try. When you write the cheese burger and what’s included in it, specify what kind of cheese you need to pay extra for separately, otherwise it contains a beef patty, cheddar cheese, and dor blue cheese , and vegetables. As a result, there was only cheddar cheese (from cheddar there is only a name; in the end, ordinary grated cheese) and that for which I paid extra separately. By the way, they asked me which cutlet to put, I said beef, in the end they put chicken, but my girlfriend took it with a chicken cutlet, maybe they thought that I should have chicken too, BUT I SAID THAT IT WAS BEEF. Friends highly recommended the burgers there, so I decided to try it, but I was very disappointed, and I’m unlikely to come next time. It’s better to go to competitors nearby, at least they do it without mistakes and give you the order you order. I hope you somehow solve this problem and the employee will be punished!!!!",

And trust me, I'm a REALLY picky person, not to say someone who's struggling with food behaviour, but Yapiko is _literally_ a lifesaver when it comes to eating! I usually go with noodles. While rolls and pizzas are the first thing that comes to mind when you hear \"Yapiko\", there are TONS of other different dishes you absolutely should true. Everything is amazing here. Although miso soup may be too salty for my liking! Not to say, the drinks, the cocktails here are awesome too. Also, there's this lucky wheel game if you come here on your birthday or up to week later, one time my colleague won a bottle of wine in the other restaurant. Lightened the mood a lot!:D The waiters and waitresses are usually extremely polite and cute, and the atmosphere feels safe overall. The interior is SPECTACULAR, unironically, I absolutely adore it. Also it's always very tidy here.\n\nAbsolutely recommend!",

    "review_text": "Terrible service and even worse food. A complete disappointment from the first minute to the last.\n\nThe order was made for 13:00 directly at the railway station - I had a transfer between trains, the time is given in minutes. At 13:10 - nothing. Called, they said that delivery takes up to 15 minutes from the moment of ordering. 20 passed... then 30... As a result, nothing was brought even at 1:30 p.m. I could just not wait and lose the ticket. In such a situation at the station, it is unforgivable.\n\nWhat is most infuriating is not the delay, but the complete lack of apology or accountability. Like it's normal. Compared to Japoshka, the courier there usually arrives earlier and is always polite. And here - a complete zero.\n\nBut it got worse when I finally saw the food.\n\nSushi is simply anti-restaurant horror.\nThe rice is completely overcooked, stuck together in a solid porridge. It is impossible to separate the roles from each other - everything just falls apart. The sushi does not hold its shape, the fish is cut crookedly and carelessly, as if someone learned how to cut on the go. Ginger is bitter, as if spoiled. It tastes like stale rice porridge with pieces of fish.\n\nThis is not sushi. This is customer abuse.\n\nWorst thing you can order: late, zero respect, and food that is simply impossible to eat.\n0 out of 10. Would not recommend to anyone.",

There’s simply no time for photos, I don’t know how the rest of us are holding ourselves together 🤭 and what’s also important, we went to the meeting on March 8, and this is very important. Customer-oriented 👍If you haven’t tried this roll delivery yet, I strongly recommend it 🥰 By the way, delivery always arrives at the appointed time. Once it happened that the courier was delayed for three minutes, he dialed and warned, it’s valuable 😊\n\nThank you to your entire PUC delivery team, for your delicious cuisine, customer focus, and your polite couriers. 🥰",

The feeling is that it was 1 yesterday's, 2 it was not boiled out because the bottom is completely white, but was simply defrosted and warmed up. The dough is strange. And I asked that it not be very fatty - in the end this is the fattiest pizza I have ever eaten. The sushi looks more or less, it doesn’t taste at all, it’s not bad, but those who have eaten it will understand that it’s delicious. I don't really like ramen. Tom yam is the only position out of all that I liked - and the rating is for it, in fact it is tasty, although not as spicy as in other establishments, but tasty and that’s the main thing. But I don’t know, maybe some other pizza they have is more delicious, or when they bake it, but this one is not. And I was still really hungry, in general the pizza was especially disappointing.

But the others also didn't have much fish. In general, they looked normal, not big, for that price I can order in another city and it's much tastier. Also, the rolls were very cold, although they stood on the table for about half an hour before eating, it seemed as if they had been prepared in advance and stored in the refrigerator",

The atmosphere of the establishment is cozy, pleasant, homely (it is emphasized by the dishes). The prices are average in the city and therefore the price/quality ratio is optimal. In addition to everything, those who are interested can learn the history of this establishment - it is also original. From the first visit I realized that I would come back here again and again.",

Cozy atmosphere, good service, delicious food, reasonable prices. For 3 people we took: veal shashlik (2 servings), lula kebab (1 serving), okroshka (1 serving), French fries (1 serving), baked potatoes with cheese (1 serving), grilled potatoes with lard (1 serving), grilled vegetables (1 serving), 2 sauces, uzvar (0.5 l) very tasty, Pepsi (0.5 l), homemade lemonade (0.3 l). The portions of the dishes are all good. They brought everything within 20-30 minutes. The bill was 800 UAH + 5% service. Everyone was happy and ate until they were full.",

Pleasant communication with the waiter, delicious liqueurs - plus 100 to the atmosphere. By the way, the dumplings are very tasty, I don't know in which \"mixed\" people who put a unit ate those dumplings, but I was in the Poltava \"Komor\" and the Kharkiv dumplings are no worse. Well, nothing is one-to-one in the world. And here, by the way, is the first dumpling shop in Kharkiv, well, there is always room to grow. The dumplings that I ate here (Kharkiv-style dumplings) had enough sauce and meat, the dumplings themselves were fluffy and tasty. My husband ate dumplings with meat in the middle and they were also very tasty, the only thing is that there could be a little more sauce, there are no questions about the dumplings. A very cool establishment in such a difficult city right now - our Kharkiv, it's cool. I hope that \"Persha Kharkivska Galushkarnya\" will grow and prosper, and even create a trend for Kharkiv halushki, because when was it bad for the \"new look\"? 😊 Good luck! 👍",

I didn't like that they only serve breakfast there until 12:30. I didn't like anything from the breakfast and I wanted to order carbonara, but I was refused. I had to order at least something so I wouldn't be hungry.\n\n2. The breakfast itself tastes very ordinary, nothing special. For the price, absolutely not worth it (in my opinion).\n\n3. Service. There was no noticeable concern from the waiters, the mood was gloomy. I was with a backpack, but I was not offered a chair for a bag (although there is one). After I ate and drank coffee, no one cleaned the dishes, and they lay there for 30-40 minutes until I left. I gave it 2 stars because they made the music quieter at my request. In general, if there are many people in the establishment, I understand the waiters, but during my stay only 2 tables were occupied.\n\nOn the plus side: very nice interior and furniture. Many non-standard menu items.\n\nConclusion: I do not recommend visiting the establishment if value for money (taste) and service is important to you.\n\nIf you need a good \"Instagram\" picture for a photo, then this is it. It is also suitable for introverts who want less attention to be paid to them.",

    "review_text": "Horrible service. I had to literally wave my arm to attract attention despite sitting next to the counter where all the waiters stood. I was completely ignored as they thought I was a foreigner and I don’t know the language. Even if the waiters noticed me they would just pass the buck saying oh it’s not my table; oh I don’t know the language! The waitress assigned to my table was the rudest I have ever experienced in my travel all around the world!! She didn’t even bother to ask for a repeat glass of wine while taking my empty glass. One doesn’t need precise language to communicate. There was only one waitress who knew English n communicated but she wasn’t serving my part of the restaurant.\nI have been to couple of Georgian restaurants in Kyiv n Dnipro and they were really courteous n good but this one was pathetic.\nFood is very average. Bread was so hard n stale. I ordered chanakhi. It was super salty. Eggplant roll with cheese n mint was good.\nAmbience is good.\nBut if this is the attitude of the staff, I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.",

Nonsense, but the young man served in the language of the occupier, so a fat three for the service. Although it would be worth putting a unit.\nI am not saying that this is a violation of the language law, and not just a tone of voice. Sorry, so no tip on the check.\nFood - I ordered cabbage rolls. For four. I would not order a second time.\nIt is possible to view the menu by QR code and pay using it, which is quite convenient.\nThere will be no problems with parking either.",

We also got a wrong order and were told if we want to get the right order we have to wait another 40 minutes (and this was said in a very unapologetic way). I mentioned that after service like this I expect a discount. Obviously, no discount was provided. I persisted that I expected some sort of concession, and with poker face the waiter left and came back 10 minutes later with a $2 bottle of wine.",

    "review_text": "Absolutely beautiful decor this is an art gallery and coffee shop combined into one.\nThe coffee is absolutely beautifully prepared with professional latte art if that's something that you enjoy of course. There's a wide range of teas also which are freshly brewed including fruits. The selection of cakes and pastries are minimal so don't expect a huge plethora of options. The price point is average and therefore affordable.\nThe decor is sublime and the high ceilings make for a very pleasant and open environment.\nThere are plug points at almost every table and there are two public toilets so all amenities are generally covered.\nThe staff are courteous and will carry out your instructions without imperfections. They could be a little bit more friendly as an improvement point though my experience was just fine.\nThe location is beautiful it is opposite the river which you can actually see from the windows.\nThe real gem of this coffee shop is the artwork. Beautiful paintings of astronauts and a general theme of space travel. Oh I'm sure they'll change this from time to time so expect the unexpected.",

In the morning they are coffee shop with pastry, mid day they are a lunch place and in the evening they are a bar and a restaurant. But as you can guess, this is hardly possible to be all of those things on a good level simultaneously.\n\nI went there for a dinner with my wife today and there are some pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n- Very nice interior design, comfortable seats\n- Good service, respectful and easy going\n- good cocktails, well at least IMHO\n- not too expensive\n- some meals are quite tasty, e.g. chicken pate was quite good\n\nCons\n- I ordered teriyaki salmon and frankly did not really like it.\n- tomato soup with Mozzarella was average\n- really, don’t expect too fancy dinner meals there\n\nA few days later I came back for a breakfast. And ordered a standard breakfast meal, I waited for 30 minutes, after that asked the waiter to check on it and they said it’s going to be another 7 minutes. It appears they simply forgot about the order.\n\nDue to the above 3/5",

    "review_text": "Came to Try Bobry this morning, read the reviews and thought as a coffee enthusiast I would give it a go.  I ordered an Espresso and a Kenyan pour over on V60.\nThe Kenyan came, it lacked flavour and was quite astringent, things you would not expect from this coffee, aftertaste was lacking and the brew seemed all out of whack, water vs coffee ratio vs brewing time.  My espresso never came... when questioned about it, was told directly that we hadn't ordered it!  The female attendedant with the sleeve tattoo at the register was rude, no customer service skills, So ordered another espresso and paid again. Espresso was over extracted, cups to cold and really shouldn't have been ordered, so all in all, not worth starting a good day here, lucky the Ukrainian coffee culture is still young here, as anyone who knows coffee wouldn't drink what they serve and enjoy it.\n\nCake was the saving grace it was very nice",

I had the Sake Maki roll (6 pcs), Udon with beef noodles, and Tyahan with teriyaki chicken for 795 UAH, or about $22. the dishes are overpriced a bit for the quality, in my opinion. The best dish I had were the udon noodles; they were done very well and tasted excellent. The quality of the beef was about average, not the best quality, but definitely not the worst either. The next best thing I had was the Maki roll; it was above average sushi. The last dish I had was the Teriyaki chicken Tyahan: the chicken was amazing, but the rice wasn't good. The rice was watery and not made like how traditional japanese fried rice should be. Overall, the restaurant has lots of potential to be very good, but hasn't reached it yet. Above average restaurant, but there is a better japanese restaurant here, so wouldn't recommend.",

But the top of the roll is peeled by hand, and it has neither appearance - because it's blackened - nor taste, because it's burnt, and the smell of burnt is also understandable. Nori blackened by fire - this is no good.\nThe ingredients list an omelet - I didn't find it. But there were caviar pieces stuck to the bottom surface of the rolls. There is no caviar in the roll - that means the caviar is from the board on which it is cooked.\nThe taste of the roll is a 4 minus.\nIn general, I have formed my own opinion and do not plan to order here anymore, and you decide for yourself.",

Well, now about the order itself. I haven't eaten such delicious sushi for a long time. And I have something to compare with.... I rate both the appearance and taste as 10 out of 10. It doesn’t fall apart, it’s not dry, but it’s just what you need. I will definitely come back again and can confidently recommend it",

    "review_text": "Updated review: I went back again to try their red veal curry and wontons and both were pretty standard; nothing special about either. The curry was alright: a bit tasty, but nothing special. It isn't made like how traditional Thai curry is supposed to be made. The veal quality was very good, but the rice and curry needs to improve. And same with wontons: they were fresh, but wasn't anything spectacular to praise about.\n\n4.4/5 really good asian restaurant; they do a lot of dishes from different asian countries but to be honest, the dishes aren't truly authentic to where they are from. However the food is really good. We had the sake maki, teriyaki wings, upon noodles with veal, chicken boa, Brooklyn pizza, and fried eggplant for 1700 uah. Not cheap restaurant and a bit overpriced, but it was really good food. All the dishes used high quality ingredients and the meat was good. The sushi was great and of high quality, the meat of the wings were tender and tasty, the noodles were superb, the boa was really good but they put too much sauce, and the pizza was amazing. I think the best dishes for us were the pizza and the noodles. Highly recommend!",

I would like to pay special attention to rice. In previous deliveries, where rolls were ordered before, there was always something wrong with it: sometimes overcooked, sometimes, on the contrary, too dry or completely tasteless. Here we were pleasantly surprised - the rice is tasty, tender, everything is as it should be!) The staff is very nice and positive, which is also a huge plus. Many thanks to you for your efforts and work. We will definitely order from you again! :)",

I don't understand the positive reviews, unless people have never tasted real sushi, but are simply fans of boiled rice porridge, generously seasoned with mayonnaise and imitation Philadelphia. This makes them basically the same in taste. Equally none. It is clear that it is impossible to taste any seafood there. But maybe that is for the better. Although no, there was one roll that overshadowed all the others. It smelled and tasted like a burnt tire. It is simply disgusting. The soy sauce is also disgusting. Wasabi and ginger are more or less, but it is difficult to get enough of them. To be fair, I have to say that this is a problem with many sushi establishments in Poltava, but still, for this money you can buy much more decent sushi.",

But in reality — dry rice, thin filling and no taste. That's why I'm wary of new deliveries. But my friends advised me to try Kanagawa Sushi, and it was a hit. I ordered the Philadelphia set with shrimp and avocado — and was absolutely delighted. The rolls are neat, with a rich taste, the shrimp is tender, the avocado is ripe, and the cheese does not interrupt the taste, but complements it. Everything arrived in perfect condition, as if it had just come from the kitchen. Now I know where to order when I want really tasty sushi without unpleasant surprises.",

At some point, I thought that it was simply impossible to find normal delivery in Dnepr. But I decided to give Kanagawa Sushi a chance - and finally felt that it was not hopeless. The rolls arrived in perfect condition, not in pieces, not cold. Everything - from the packaging to the taste - was top notch. Fresh fish, balanced taste, neat presentation. It is obvious that they work here with respect for the customer. If you, like me, are tired of \"one-time\" deliveries, where the food is in a hurry - try Kanagawa Sushi. This is the first time in a long time when I finished the sushi and immediately wanted to order again.",

I ordered the Thai rice and what I got tasted like bottom tier burnt jollof rice, the shrimp tasted like nuggets. The cocktail I ordered (passion fruit lemonade) tasted really underwhelming and by half of the glass,I was sipping only on water and ice.very little of the flavour was left.\nHeads up : they charge you seperately for making your food spicy.",

Place does offer Sushi 🍣, burgers, and Ramen at the same time 🙄. The non alcoholic drinks weren't that's good as they look on menu.\n\nI would advise to visit this place if you just want to show off ☺️ with alcohol, hookah and expensive bill on the table.\nThere are restaurants who specializes in either Sushi or burgers, I recommend visiting them If you want taste.",

The staff is polite, but the service was a bit slow, especially with a large influx of guests.\n\nRegarding the cuisine - the dishes were presented beautifully, but the taste left much to be desired. For example, the pasta was a little overcooked, and the sauce was too salty. I liked the dessert more, but it was still not \"wow\".\n\nThe prices are above average, and for such a price I would like to get more consistent quality. Maybe we will come back again to give the institution a second chance, but for now - a solid three.",

I especially liked the eggplant salad, and the pear tea won my heart.\nThe whole family was satisfied.

    "review_text": "The establishment is right next to my house, so to speak. We often go to this chain of establishments. This time I don't quite understand the concept of the place. Perhaps the guys still need to get used to it and feel the new place. I just don't remember why I'd go back. I'll single out the Medovik, incredibly delicious for only 87 UAH. I guarantee you'll enjoy it. Pizza, well, pizza, we're used to good pizza at Bono Frateli. The location is simply cosmic, in a couple of years you'll have to book a table 5 days in advance. I think you can hold tastings and test new dishes, the place is ideal for such presentations.",

New visitors came and they were seated at comfortable tables. Waiter forgot about us and did not suggest another table.\nWhat about food: everything was delicious, nothing to complain about)",

    "review_text": "Finally Dnipro got a real italian cuisine. Food is extremely delicious there, interior is awesome.\nWe had a Black Risotto and Mortadella Pinsa. I am a \"pasta person\", but that risotto is in my favorites list since then. Pinsa was delectable as well. We were so full that decided to go next day for coffee and dessert, because they were so attractive.\nWe weren't mistaking. The desserts were delicious and maximally close to those you can taste in Italy.\n\nThe only thing that confused me is a feeling that all waiters are in crazy hurry.\nThe first day the girl sent my friend's order to kitchen via smartphone (which is very impressive) before my friend made a final choice. The next day a my plate with remains of profiterole was taken by the waiter before I finished it while I was talking to my family.\n\nAnyway, despite that little rush, I would highly recommend anyone to visit Gianni Vino.",

    "review_text": "4.4/5 pretty good italian restaurant. i had the margo pinza, and the tortilloni with veal meat and ravioli with salmon tartar for 1184 UAH. the pinza was the best pinza in ukraine and definitely a lot better than even many pinza places in italy; the sauce, cheese, and dough were all amazing. However, the pastas were not anything too special; they were cold when we received it and didn't taste fresh. Very overpriced restaurant and you can have better italian pasta for cheaper in other restaurants. But the pinza was the best and I would only recommend to go for the pinza, but not the pasta, as there are better italian restaurants in ukraine.",
